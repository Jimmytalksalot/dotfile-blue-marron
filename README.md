# üì¶ Installation 

To install this fancy rice, install the apps required first!

```waybar hyprland rofi git neovim kitty cava```

After that, clone this repository, and add all the folders to your .config file. The path should look something like this.

```~/.config/``` 

After that, reload Hyprland, and everything should work fine. If it doesn't, let me know here.
